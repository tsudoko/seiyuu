% maybe TODO: store vn -> character relations instead of whole requests,
%             keep characters in regular "id" caches
%     â†‘ reliability wise it would be better to request one vn at a time,
%        since if a batch process dies midway we'd have some missing
%        records which wouldn't be refetched

% would be less hacky to just recreate an API server locally probably,
% but that's too much work
%
% i.e. right now only exact requests are cached, so if you do "get
% character (vn = 1)" and it returns characters 100, 101, 102, "get
% character (id = [100,101,102])" won't use the cache even though the
% data is all there
%
% this is not an issue as long as we search by the same field in
% every request for a given data type, though, and that's what we
% do currently
